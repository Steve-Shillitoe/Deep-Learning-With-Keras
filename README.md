# Deep-Learning-With-Keras
An exploration of Deep Learning with Google's latest Tensorflow 2 library and Keras.

The code modules in this project were written while following Udemy's 
Complete Tensorflow 2 and Keras Deep Learning Bootcamp course.

Modules prefixed with 'ANN', Artificial Neural Network contain dense layer neural networks 
used for regression analysis & classification.  There are also two modules that demonstrate
the use of TensorBoard to monitor model fitting.
